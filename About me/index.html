          <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I grew up in Norton MA, a small town south of Boston. I took quite the
                  peculiar route through school, finishing a Bachelor's in Math and CS at the Harvard Extension School during my 
                  Junior year of high school. I then hopped straight into a Physics Master's program at UMass Dartmouth. I recieved
                  my degree in May of 2023. I currently work as a software engineer for a robotics automation company.

          <p>I am always looking for ways to become smarter, and apply intelligence to every facet of my life.</p>

          <p>I have always sought a deep understanding of everything around me. I strive for a level of understanding that changes 
                  my very perception of reality. You have truly grasped a fact or idea if it is an unmovable part of your mind's awareness
                  whenever you happen to look in that direction.</p>

          <p>Empathy is one thing the world needs more of. I am of course far from perfect in this regard, but I strive diligently 
            to do better. I find it helpful to recall the following: for any fact about someone else that you have failed to understand,
            there is a corresponding piece of yourself that you have failed to understand. I view this as a precise, almost mathematical
            statement. If you think eg. "I don't understand how other people can be so lazy", you also don't understand why you yourself
            are not lazy. For if you truly grasped the cause and effect underlying your work ethic, you would be able to point at missing 
            events in other people's history to explain why they were different. Reflect on your experiences and posit which key events from your 
            past may be missing for others. Consider other possibilities as well. The reasons for the differences you observe between yourself 
            and others are not necessarily satisfying or tractable, but they must exist.</p>
